# photo-blog
The project is not 100% where I intended to take it but the VMP is to share  travel photos I collected over the years. So it's going to be a continuous project for me with additional features coming soon. It's  SPA which allows  users to see information without having swich to a new window. 

Everything dynamically renders directly from the database. Having SPA, means users can simply click on the logo at top left corner to return to the home page. Clicking on a picture will displayed a full size picture and some background information about the pictures. As of right now it's duummy text since my application is hosted  and  running on my local sever not www.

   I used node.js , html, css , bootstrap and ejs to create the UI.  Connneting my application to Mongodb allows me to  insert text and photo data and render everything back to the application when users click on a picture. This approach will allow  me  to continue to add more  photos and information in the feature
